For the main program, prompt the user to create a new truck. The user can set the maximum fuel capacity, and MPG. Start the truck with a full take of gas, and start with the location as 'Cleveland.' Allow the user to drive the truck to different locations, and refuel, but do not let the user refuel at a location that does not have gas, and do not let the user drive the truck further than the distance the current fuel will allow.
